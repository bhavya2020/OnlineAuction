  schedule:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:

    steps:
    # Step 1: run a standard checkout action, provided by github

      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        ref: deploy
        # submodules: 'recursive'     ### may be needed in your situation

    # Step 2: run this sync action - specify the upstream repo, upstream branch to sync with, and target sync branch
    - name: Pull (Fast-Forward) upstream changes
      id: sync
      uses: aormsby/Fork-Sync-With-Upstream-action@v2.1
